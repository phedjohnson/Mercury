Project Title: Mercury

================================================================
This code has been developed in the Windows 10 bash environment;
it works well in that environment and on a typical Linux machine.
It may also work well on Mac machines and in a traditional
Windows programming environment, but I am not sure.

This code is compiled with the GNU g++ compiler as follows:
1) In the terminal, run the command:
g++ -O3 Mercury.cpp -o exec.exe
to compile the code with optimization.

2) To run the executable, enter the following command:
./exec.exe

3) Once the code finishes running, the data needs to be
reorganized for the Matlab plotting routine. Compile
the code "ReorganizeData.cpp" and run its executable.

4) There are two choices for flow visualization:
i) Run the ViewEvolution_GeneralField.m file in
Matlab. Edit the "field" variable
to look at different aspects of the flow

ii) In a python environment (I use the Spyder environment),
run the progress_p.py code to view the progression
of the pressure field.

================================================================
Some Notes:

The initial condition for the flow is set in the U_init subroutine.
You should set the t_final variable appropriately.

The default geometry is a 2 x 1 rectangle. It is set by
{LEFT, RIGHT, BASE, TOP} at the top of the code. Mx and My
are the cell counts in the x and y directions, respectively.

Larger cell counts will yield better-resolved simulations,
but at increased cost.
